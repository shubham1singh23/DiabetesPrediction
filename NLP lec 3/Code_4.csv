Absolutely thrilling! Tom Cruise never disappoints.
"Too many stunts, not enough story."
A visual spectacle with a gripping plot.
"Just average, nothing special."
Terrible acting from the supporting cast.
Loved every minute of it!
Mediocre at best.
Tom Cruise is a legend!
Didn't live up to the hype.
Well-paced and entertaining.
The action sequences were mind-blowing!

One of the dullest movies I've seen.
A refreshing take on the genre.
